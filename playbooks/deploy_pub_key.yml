# Explanation of the playbook:
# hosts:  Specifies the target host(s) or group of hosts where the
#          public key will be installed.
#
# become: true: If the remote_username is not the user Ansible
#         connects as, and you need elevated privileges to modify their authorized_keys file, use become: true to escalate privileges (e.g., via sudo).
#
# ansible.builtin.authorized_key:
#         The module responsible for managing SSH authorized keys.
#
# user:   The username on the remote machine whose authorized_keys
#         file will be modified.
#
# state: present:
#         Ensures the key is present in the authorized_keys file.
#         Use "absent" to remove a key.
#
# key:    "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/ansible_key.pub') }}": This uses the lookup plugin to read the content of your public key file from the Ansible control machine and pass it to the remote host.
# path:   (Optional) If the authorized_keys file is not in the default location (~/.ssh/authorized_keys) for the specified user, you can provide the custom path here.
#
#
# Usage:
# 1. Ensure you have your public key (e.g., ansible_key.pub)
#    in the ~/.ssh/ directory on your Ansible control machine.
# 2. Update the hosts and user fields in the playbook as needed.
# 3. Run the playbook with:
#
#    ansible-playbook your_playbook_name.yml -i inventory_file --ask-pass
#
# Note: If you're using SSH keys without a passphrase, you can omit the --ask-pass option.
#
# Note: If you need to use sudo to become another user, you might also need to provide the --ask-become-pass option:
#
#    ansible-playbook your_playbook_name.yml -i inventory_file --ask-pass -e ansible_become_password='YourSudoPasswordHere'

        key: "{{ lookup('file', '/ansible/local/ssh-keys/ansible/id_ed25519.pub') }}" # Path to your public key on the control machine
        # path: /ansible/local/ssh_keys/ansible/id_ed25519.pub # Optional: specify a custom path if needed
        manage_dir: yes # Optional: create the .ssh directory if it doesn't exist
